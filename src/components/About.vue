			<p>I've been called a workaholic but it's not true. I just like to do things properly.</p>
			<p>
				I've been a copywriter, a professional fiddle player, a line cook, and a door-to-door salesman. I bake sourdough when I'm stressed, my
				favorite beer is all of them, and I am a champion of the oxford comma.
			</p>
			<p>I currently live in Atlanta with my fiance and my dog, Rocco. He's a really good boy.</p>
